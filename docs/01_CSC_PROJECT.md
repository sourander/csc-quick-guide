# Steps for creating a project

Assuming if you created your CSC account and have access to MyCSC, you can create a project by following the steps below:

**Login to MyCSC with your CSC user account or Haka/Virtu account.**

The steps are the same as in [Creating a new project > Student](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-project/#student) page, but fewer, and prettier pictures.
