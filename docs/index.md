!!! tip

    CSC resources are powerful but require careful usage. Always start small before running heavy jobs.

    If you are new to Linux or Slurm, review the **Linux basics for CSC** or the **CSC Quick reference (pd)** cheat sheet before proceeding. The can be found in [CSC Tutorials](https://docs.csc.fi/support/tutorials/).
