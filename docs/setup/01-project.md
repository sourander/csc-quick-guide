# Creating a project

Assuming you have created your CSC account and have access to MyCSC, you can create a project by following the steps below:

## Login

**Login to MyCSC with your CSC user account or Haka/Virtu account.**

The steps are similar to those on the [Creating a new project > Student](https://docs.csc.fi/accounts/how-to-create-new-project/#student) page.

You will typically receive:

* 60,000 CPU billing units
* 10,000 GPU billing units
* 30,000 Storage billing units

These are virtual units. No actual costs are generated for you personally.

## Create Project

**Read the terms and conditions, confirm your acceptance, and click *Create project*.**

Once accepted, the Project is created.
